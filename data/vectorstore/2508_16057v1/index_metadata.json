Numerous studies have employed computational methods to assess and quantify factors related to urban comfort such as greenery coverage, thermal comfort, and walkability. However, a clear definition of urban comfort and its comprehensive evaluation framework remain elusive. Our research explores the theoretical interpretations and methodologies for assessing urban comfort within digital planning, emphasising three key dimensions: multidimensional analysis, data support, and AI assistance. KEYWORDS: urban planning, street view imagery, streetscape, human-centred GeoAI, AI agent 1 The Multidimensional Nature of Urban Comfort Comfort is defined as the degree of satisfaction with the environment of a person (Frontczak et al., 2012; Shin, 2016). In the built environment, there are many environmental factors that have been proven to be associated with human comfort sensation, including visual elements (Klemm et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2025), physiological data of individuals (Chwalek et al., 2024), occupant behaviour (Miller et al., 2025), meteorological indicators (Xie et al., 2019; Miller et al., 2023; Mosteiro-Romero et al., 2024), the design of public places (Santos Nouri et al., 2018), the dynamics of life quality (Lei et al., 2025) and so on. Urban comfort, in this context, refers specifically to the experience of comfort within the urban environment. It is inherently a multidimensional concept due to the complexity and variability of the urban physical environment. Unlike general comfort, which can be defined at the individual level, urban comfort emerges as a collective and spatially embedded phenomenon, shaped by the interplay between environmental attributes and human perception.",

      "text": "Unlike general comfort, which can be defined at the individual level, urban comfort emerges as a collective and spatially embedded phenomenon, shaped by the interplay between environmental attributes and human perception. The diverse components of the urban environment evoke a wide range of perceptions in individuals (Salesses et al., 2013; Dubey et al., 2016; Qiu et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2023; Ito et al., 2024), making it unsuitable for reduction into a single numerical index or one-dimensional measure, as it is often the case with other concepts in planning such as walkability. In addition, \u2217filip@nus.edu.sg guA ]IA.sc[ 1v75061.8052:viXra comfort is highly subjective, varying significantly from person to person based on their preferences, experiences, and expectations (Castaldo et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2018), which adds another layer of complexity to the understanding of urban comfort. Figure 1: Proposed multidimensional framework of urban comfort. Broadly, urban comfort can be categorised into two main dimensions: environmental comfort and social comfort, as described in Figure 1. Environmental comfort primarily refers to the perceptual and experiential satisfaction of people with the physical aspects of the built environment, such as thermal comfort (Rupp et al., 2015), visual comfort (Lam et al., 2020), and acoustic comfort (Yang and Kang, 2005). In contrast, social comfort relates to how well the urban environment supports human interactions and behavioural needs. It emphasizes the functional ability of spaces to facilitate desired user activities, such as walkability, accessibility, and safety. Examples include walkingcomfort(Maetal.,2021)andcyclingcomfort(Ayachietal.,2015), whichreflecthowurban infrastructure influences ease of movement and user experience. Urbancomfortisdeeplyintertwinedwiththecharacteristicsoftheurbanenvironment(Guly \u0301asetal., 2006). People experience different levels of comfort in heterogeneous urban settings (Kim et al., 2022), and even within the same environment, individuals may perceive comfort differently across various dimensions (Du et al., 2023). This dual-layer relationship indicates that urban comfort is not only context-dependent but also multidimensional. Instead of considering urban comfort as a single scalar value, it is more accurate to conceptualise it as a vector U that captures the C multidimensional nature of urban comfort across several dimensions. Mathematically, this can be expressed as U = [D ,D ,...,D ], where: C 1 2 n \u2022 D represents each dimension of urban comfort (e.g., thermal comfort, visual comfort). i \u2022 U is the vector of all the dimensions of comfort, reflecting the multidimensional aspects of C urban comfort without reducing them to a single aggregate value.",

In the following sections, we further propose the four steps of urban comfort assessment and the role of AI algorithms in modelling urban comfort for digital planning, as shown in Figure Figure 2: Urban comfort assessment framework in this study. 2 Four-Step Framework for Data-Driven Urban Comfort Assessment To effectively evaluate urban comfort in its multidimensional attributes, we propose a structured, data-driven assessment framework encompassing four key steps: conducting comfort surveys, developing comfort models, scaling up urban comfort predictions, and performing regional validation, as illustrated in Figure 3. Each step is data-supported, leveraging three essential data streams: geospatial data to characterise the urban environment in the comfort survey, survey results to capture human comfort perception, and additional comfort survey data from distinct sites for model validation. As shown in Figure 3, the process begins with a comfort survey conducted at a specified urban location, recording geospatial characteristics (X ...X ) and various comfort dimensions (D ...D ). 1 n 1 n Subsequently,thecollectedgeospatialandcomfortdataundergomodellingtocapturethenon-linear relationship between the urban environment and human comfort. This model enables scaling up predictions to more urban areas across the city based on extended geospatial data, facilitating an Figure 3: Data-driven urban comfort assessment framework. urban-scale comfort assessment. Finally, the comfort model is validated using survey data from an additional, designated validation location. 3 AI-assisted Comfort Modelling in the Era of Digital Planning Data-driven, multidimensional urban comfort modelling can be further enhanced by artificial intelligence to support digital planning more effectively (Figure 4). AI models offer significant advantages, includinghigh-dimensionaldatarepresentation, non-linearrelationshipmodelling, scalability, generalisability, and spatial-temporal understanding, making them better suited than traditional methods for tackling the complexities of comfort modelling.

Toimplementourproposedfour-step, AI-assistedurbancomfortassessmentframework, weselected Singapore as the study area for a focused analysis of urban thermal comfort, given its strong emphasis on urban liveability and resilience in a high-density, tropical environment. As illustrated in Figure 5, this case study adheres rigorously to the framework\u2019s stages: conducting a comfort survey, developing comfort models, scaling up urban comfort predictions, and performing in-field validation. Figure 6: SVI-supported visual assessment as a replacement for in-field comfort survey. In the comfort survey phase, we opted for a more efficient online approach using street view images instead of the traditional in-field survey combined with in-field validation, as shown in Figure 6. This method leverages information embedded in street view images and utilises AI-based CNN feature extraction to replace in-field surveys that typically require extensive environmental measurements, participant involvement, and significant human and financial resources. Nonetheless, for model validation, we still conducted a field comfort survey to confirm the model\u2019s reliability. Forcomfortmodelling,wedevelopedtwotypesofmodels: acomfortpredictionmodelandacomfort inference model (Figure 5). The prediction model employs a DNN to achieve high accuracy and generalisation capabilities, enabling us to apply it to 92,233 street view images across Singapore to predict thermal comfort levels along urban streets. The inference model, based on linear regression, interprets feature weights, allowing us to identify which factors significantly influence urban thermalcomfort.",

As an addition, this mapping can provide valuable insights for urban planners to pinpoint zones requiring efforts to enhance street-level thermal comfort. 5 Contributions and Limitations This paper establishes a multidimensional framework for understanding urban comfort, introducing four key steps for assessing urban comfort. Additionally, it examines the supportive role of AI in urban comfort modelling within the context of digital urban planning. In the case study, we apply this framework to assess urban-scale thermal comfort in Singapore, utilising CNN, DNN, and other advanced technologies for thermal comfort modelling. The resulting urban thermal comfort map of Singapore represents a valuable resource for digital urban planning efforts. However, this study has several limitations. First, considering the notion of data sources, we incorporate three key modelling methods in this framework to support the objective. However, this approach does not fully account for the diverse auxiliary roles that various AI technologies could play in urban comfort modelling, depending on specific use cases. Future research could explore how different AI techniques-such as reinforcement learning, generative models, or multiagent systems-can further enhance urban comfort assessment and digital planning. Second, the Figure 7: Comfort mapping for thermal comfort analytics in Singapore. case study focuses solely on thermal comfort as a one-dimensional aspect of urban comfort, without extendingtothemultidimensionalcomfortmodelproposedintheframework. Futurestudiesshould consider developing and validating a multidimensional comfort model to substantiate the reliability of this conceptual framework for urban comfort assessment.
